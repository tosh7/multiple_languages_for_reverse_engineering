# multiple_languages_for_reverse_engineering
Just sample codes with multiple languages for reverse engineering with [Hopper](https://www.hopperapp.com/).

## What is Hopper?
Hopper Disassembler, the reverse engineering tool that lets you disassemble, decompile and debug your applications.  
Hooper reverses from binary file to accembly language. Hopper also makes mock C code from that accembly language.

## Launguages
You can check how each launguages is reverse engineered with Hooper.
